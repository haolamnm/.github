# Introduction

### Welcome to The Contributing Guides!

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: Itâ€™s people like you that make my project better. If youâ€™re unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is that youâ€™ll be politely asked to change something. I appreciate any sort of contribution, and I donâ€™t want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

### Why you should read these Guidelines?

By following these guidelines, you help ensure that your contributions are effectively integrated into the project. I respect the time and effort you put into contributing, and by respecting these guidelines, you help maintain a collaborative and efficient workflow. In return, I will do my best to address your issues, assess your changes, and assist you in finalizing your pull requests.

### What we're looking for?

I welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, your contributions help make this project better for everyone. Here are some ways you can get involved:

- Bug Reports and Feature Requests: Found a bug or have an idea for a new feature? Let me know by opening an issue.

Code Contributions: Help fix bugs, add new features, or improve the performance of the project. I'll help guide you through the process

- Documentation Improvements: Spotted a typo in the docs? Think you can explain something better? Then submit a pull request with your fix.

- Tests: Help me ensure reliability by adding or improving test cases.

- Discussions: Engage with the community by participating in issue discussions or brainstorming ideas for new features.

- Tutorials and Blog Posts: Share your knowledge by writing tutorials or blog posts that showcase how to use the project effectively.

### Contributions that I'm NOT looking for.

To save us both time, here are some types of contributions I am not looking for:

- Unsolicted Refactorings: While I appreciate your enthusiasm, major rewrites or reorganizations of the codebase may not align with the project's direction.

- Unclear or incomplete submissions: Submissions without enough context, clear descriptions, or actionable details are hard to review and may be closed.

# Ground Rules

To ensure a positive and productive experience for everyone, here are some guidelines and expectations:

### Expectations for behavior.

- Be respectful and considerate: Treat everyone with kindness, whether you're discussing code, suggesting improvements, or providing feedback.

- Keep communication clear: If you're reporting an issue or submitting a pull request, provide enough context to make it easy to understand and review.

- Be welcoming: Encourage and support new contributors, regardless of their background or experience level.

### Technical responsibilities.

- Test your changes: Make sure your contributions work as expected and donâ€™t break existing functionality.

- Follow project conventions: Keep the codebase clean and consistent by adhering to the project's existing style and practices.

- Discuss major changes: Open an issue to propose and discuss big changes before implementing them. Transparency and collaboration make the project better.

- Keep it simple: Avoid over-engineering. Donâ€™t add new classes or dependencies unless theyâ€™re absolutely necessary.

### Other notes

- Cross-platform compatibility: If your changes affect functionality, ensure they work across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- Incremental improvements: Aim to make small, manageable contributions. One focused improvement per pull request is ideal.

# Your First Contribution

If this is your first time contributing to this project (or to open source in general), welcome! Iâ€™m excited to have you here. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

### Where to start?

- **Beginner-friendly issues**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue`. These are designed to be approachable, typically requiring only a few lines of code or minor changes.

- **Help wanted**: Issues with the `help wanted` label are slightly more involved but still great for new contributors looking for a bit of a challenge.

You can find these issues by browsing the [issue list]().

By following this process, you help keep the project running smoothly and make it easier for everyone involved. Thank you for your contribution! ðŸŽ‰

# How to report a bug?
### Security disclosures!

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Instead, email me at [haolamnm.work@gmail.com](mailto:haolamnm.work@gmail.com). Iâ€™ll look into it as soon as possible and keep you informed of the steps weâ€™re taking to address the issue.

To determine whether you're dealing with a security issue, ask yourself:
- Can I access something I shouldnâ€™t have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of these questions is "yes," please report it as a security issue. Even if youâ€™re unsure, itâ€™s better to err on the side of caution and email me directly.

### How to file a bug report?

When reporting a bug, you can use the following [bug report template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) to provide the necessary information. All the necessary information is included in the template, so you can just copy-paste it into the issue description.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement?

### Project direction

Before suggesting a feature, please consider the projectâ€™s goals and direction. If youâ€™re unsure, you can open an issue to discuss your idea and gather feedback.

- The goal of this project is to [briefly describe your goals or philosophy, e.g., "create lightweight, modular tools for X purpose."]

- Features should align with [specific guidelines or focus areas, e.g., "simplicity, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility."]

This ensures that any new feature or enhancement contributes meaningfully to the project and benefits the community.

### Submitting a feature request

To suggest a feature or enhancement, please follow these steps

1. **Check existing requests**: Before submitting a new idea, take a look at the feature requests list to ensure it hasnâ€™t already been suggested.
2. **Open a discussion**: If the idea is complex or requires community input, consider starting a discussion in the issues section to gauge interest and get feedback.
3. **Submit a feature request**: Submit a request using the [feature request template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml). Include a clear description of the proposed feature and why it would be valuable.

Once submitted, I will review the suggestion and may ask for further clarification. For larger features, there may be some back-and-forth discussion to refine the idea.

Thank you for helping improve this project -- I appreciate your contribution!

# Code review process

### What to expect?

Since I manage this project independently, the code review process is straightforward:

1. Initial review: Once you submit a pull request (PR), Iâ€™ll review it personally. I aim to review contributions within [X days, e.g., 3-5 days] of submission.
2. Feedback and revisions:
  - If the PR requires changes, Iâ€™ll leave comments directly on the code or in the PR discussion.
  - Youâ€™re encouraged to address feedback and push updates to the same branch.
3. Acceptance or follow-up:
  - Once the changes meet the projectâ€™s standards, Iâ€™ll merge the PR.
  - If the PR doesnâ€™t align with the projectâ€™s goals or remains inactive for more than [X weeks, e.g., 2 weeks], I may close it with a note explaining the decision.

### Commit access.

At the moment, I donâ€™t grant direct commit access to contributors. If youâ€™re a regular contributor and have consistently made valuable contributions, I may consider adding you as a collaborator in the future.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as I balance reviewing contributions alongside managing the project!
