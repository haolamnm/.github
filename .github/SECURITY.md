## Security Definition

A **security vulnerability** is defined as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**. Mitigation of these vulnerabilities typically involves coding changes but could also include specification changes or even the deprecation of functionality (e.g., removal of affected protocols or features).

This definition is based on the guidelines set by [MITRE.org CNA Rules 7.1](https://cve.mitre.org).

If you suspect a vulnerability in our project, please report it to me so I can address it promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, **DO NOT** open a GitHub issue. Instead, please report it to me directly via email at [haolamnm.work@gmail.com](mailto:haolamnm.work@gmail.com) with the subject line "[Security Vulnerability] - [Repository Name] - [Brief Description]".

Please provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including how to reproduce it, your environment, and any steps you have taken to mitigate the issue. If possible, include a proof-of-concept or a working exploit. Include any relevant logs or screenshots that might help me understand the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

I take security seriously and aim to respond to reports in a timely manner. Once I receive your report, I will investigate it and notify you of the steps I plan to take. I will also keep you informed about our progress and any fixes.

I ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed. I will work with you to ensure that any fix is rolled out safely and efficiently.

## Security Updates

When a security issue is addressed, I will release a new version of the project and provide details of the fix in the changelog or release notes. I recommend keeping track of new releases to ensure you are using the most secure version.

## Acknowledgments

I appreciate your help in keeping this project secure! Your efforts make a difference and contribute to the safety of our users and the broader community. Thank you for your contributions to security research and responsible disclosure.
